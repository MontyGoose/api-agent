# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds a new proxy API endpoint to the FastAPI service for sending messages to AI Agents. The endpoint will act as an intermediary, forwarding requests to a Python SDK while handling authentication, request validation, and response formatting.

**Endpoint:**
- `POST /api/v1/agent/{id}/call` - Send a message to an AI agent and receive a response

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want to send messages to AI agents via POST /api/v1/agent/{id}/call, so that I can interact with agents and receive their responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client makes a POST request to /api/v1/agent/{id}/call with a message THEN the system SHALL validate the request format and forward it to the Python SDK
2. WHEN the Python SDK processes the agent call THEN the system SHALL return the agent's response in a structured JSON format
3. WHEN the request message is invalid or missing THEN the system SHALL return a 422 Unprocessable Entity response with validation details
4. WHEN the agent ID does not exist THEN the system SHALL return a 404 Not Found response
5. IF the Python SDK call fails or times out THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate HTTP error response

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want the agent call endpoint to respect authentication and authorization, so that only authorized users can send messages to agents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an unauthenticated request is made to the agent call endpoint THEN the system SHALL return a 401 Unauthorized response
2. WHEN an authenticated request is made with insufficient permissions THEN the system SHALL return a 403 Forbidden response
3. WHEN an authenticated request is made with proper permissions THEN the system SHALL forward the request to the Python SDK

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the agent call endpoint to follow the existing API patterns and conventions, so that it integrates seamlessly with the current codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the agent call endpoint THEN the system SHALL follow the existing router organization under /api/v1/
2. WHEN implementing the agent call endpoint THEN the system SHALL use Pydantic models for request/response validation
3. WHEN implementing the agent call endpoint THEN the system SHALL include proper OpenAPI documentation with tags and descriptions
4. WHEN implementing the agent call endpoint THEN the system SHALL use structured logging for observability

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper error handling and logging for the agent call endpoint, so that I can monitor and troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Python SDK call fails THEN the system SHALL log the error with structured logging including request details
2. WHEN a request validation fails THEN the system SHALL return a 422 Unprocessable Entity response with detailed validation errors
3. WHEN the Python SDK returns an unexpected response format THEN the system SHALL handle it gracefully and return a 502 Bad Gateway response
4. WHEN the agent call endpoint is called THEN the system SHALL log the request and response details for audit purposes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage for the agent call endpoint, so that I can ensure reliability and maintainability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the agent call endpoint THEN the system SHALL include unit tests for the endpoint
2. WHEN implementing the agent call endpoint THEN the system SHALL include tests for authentication and authorization scenarios
3. WHEN implementing the agent call endpoint THEN the system SHALL include tests for error handling scenarios including SDK failures
4. WHEN implementing the agent call endpoint THEN the system SHALL include integration tests that mock the Python SDK responses
