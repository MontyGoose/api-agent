# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature updates the existing mock Agent SDK implementation with a more concrete implementation based on the actual Agent SDK structure. The current MockAgentSDK provides basic mock functionality, but we need to implement a more realistic SDK that follows the actual Agent SDK patterns including session management, JWT authentication, and proper API integration while maintaining compatibility with existing endpoints.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Agent SDK to implement proper session management with JWT authentication, so that it can authenticate with the actual agent service infrastructure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initializing the Agent SDK THEN the system SHALL support JWT token-based authentication
2. WHEN a session is established THEN the system SHALL maintain the session state for subsequent API calls
3. WHEN the JWT token is invalid or expired THEN the system SHALL raise appropriate authentication errors
4. WHEN no session is active THEN the system SHALL prevent agent operations and return clear error messages
5. IF session initialization fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information for troubleshooting

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Agent SDK to implement the AsyncAgent class structure, so that it follows the actual SDK patterns and supports all required agent properties.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating an AsyncAgent instance THEN the system SHALL support all required fields including agent_id, agent_name, env, base_url, and configuration options
2. WHEN initializing an agent THEN the system SHALL validate required parameters and set appropriate defaults
3. WHEN loading agent details THEN the system SHALL fetch agent configuration from the remote service
4. WHEN agent initialization fails due to access restrictions THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages about scope limitations
5. IF an agent_id is not provided THEN the system SHALL generate a UUID for the agent

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Agent SDK to implement the view() method for retrieving agent details, so that the existing agent status API can work with real agent data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calling view() with an agent_id THEN the system SHALL return agent details in the expected JSON format
2. WHEN calling view() without parameters THEN the system SHALL use the current agent's ID
3. WHEN the agent exists THEN the system SHALL return complete agent configuration including status, llmModel, and other properties
4. WHEN the agent does not exist THEN the system SHALL raise AgentNotFoundError
5. IF the API call fails THEN the system SHALL handle HTTP errors appropriately and raise SDKError with details

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Agent SDK to maintain backward compatibility with existing interfaces, so that current API endpoints continue to work without changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the new SDK THEN the system SHALL maintain the existing AgentSDKInterface contract
2. WHEN the get_agent() method is called THEN the system SHALL return data in the same format as the current mock
3. WHEN integrating with existing services THEN the system SHALL work with current AgentService and dependency injection
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL raise the same exception types as the current implementation
5. IF configuration is missing THEN the system SHALL fall back to appropriate defaults or mock behavior

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper configuration management for the Agent SDK, so that it can be configured for different environments and use cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the SDK THEN the system SHALL support environment-specific settings (DEV, QA, PROD)
2. WHEN setting base URLs THEN the system SHALL support different API endpoints for different environments
3. WHEN configuring timeouts THEN the system SHALL respect request timeout settings
4. WHEN using in development THEN the system SHALL support mock mode for testing without external dependencies
5. IF environment variables are provided THEN the system SHALL use them to configure SDK settings

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling in the Agent SDK, so that I can properly diagnose and handle different failure scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL raise clear authentication-related errors
2. WHEN network requests fail THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information including status codes
3. WHEN agent access is restricted THEN the system SHALL indicate scope limitations and available alternatives
4. WHEN malformed responses are received THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully and provide meaningful errors
5. IF the SDK is used incorrectly THEN the system SHALL provide helpful error messages for common mistakes

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Agent SDK to support both mock and real implementations, so that I can develop and test locally while deploying with real agent services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN in development mode THEN the system SHALL support a mock implementation that doesn't require external services
2. WHEN in production mode THEN the system SHALL use the real agent service endpoints
3. WHEN switching between modes THEN the system SHALL maintain the same interface and behavior patterns
4. WHEN using mock mode THEN the system SHALL provide realistic test data that matches real agent responses
5. IF configuration determines the mode THEN the system SHALL automatically select the appropriate implementation

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage for the new Agent SDK implementation, so that I can ensure reliability and maintainability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the new SDK THEN the system SHALL include unit tests for all public methods
2. WHEN testing authentication THEN the system SHALL include tests for valid and invalid JWT scenarios
3. WHEN testing agent operations THEN the system SHALL include tests for successful and error cases
4. WHEN testing configuration THEN the system SHALL verify different environment and parameter combinations
5. IF integration tests are needed THEN the system SHALL mock external dependencies appropriately
